# Recommendations
Here is the result of building a recommender based on Boardgame Geek ratings for games. Here I built a recommender which I used to decide what board game I wanted to buy. 

Surprisingly the recommender worked pretty good and I ended up buying the game after I played it!

We played Ticket to Ride with the niece and nephew over the holiday, and all they wanted to play was 'The Train Game'.
